# Archivy

Archivy is a self-hosted knowledge repository that allows you to safely preserve useful content that contributes to your own personal, searchable and extensible wiki.

Features:

- If you add bookmarks, their web-pages contents' will be saved to ensure that you will **always** have access to it, following the idea of [digital preservation](https://jeffhuang.com/designed_to_last/).
- Login module that allows you to host the service on a server
- Plugin system to allow people to publish and write extensions to archivy
- Notes are stored in an extended markdown format with footnotes, LaTeX math rendering, syntax highlighting and more. 
- CLI that provides a nice backend interface to the app
- [Git integration](https://github.com/archivy/archivy-git)
- Backend API for flexibility and user enhancements
- Everything is a file! For ease of access and editing, all the content is stored in markdown files with yaml front matter.
- Extensible search with Elasticsearch and its Query DSL
