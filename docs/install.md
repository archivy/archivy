## From pip

You can easily install archivy with `pip`.


- Make sure your system has Python, pip and [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org) installed. Pandoc allows us to convert between different formats and is an awesome tool you can download [here](https://pandoc.org/installing.html).
- Install the python package with `pip install archivy`
- There you go! You should be able to start the app by running `archivy run` in your terminal.

## With docker

You can also use archivy with docker.

See [Installing with docker](docker.md) for instructions on this.

We might implement an AppImage install. Comment [here](https://github.com/archivy/archivy/issues/44) if you'd like to see that happen.
