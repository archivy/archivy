# Archivy

Archivy is a self-hostable knowledge repository that allows you to preserve content in your own personal, searchable and extensible wiki.

Features:

- If you add bookmarks, their web-pages contents' will be saved to ensure that you will **always** have access to it, following the idea of [digital preservation](https://jeffhuang.com/designed_to_last/).
- Bidirectional links between notes.
- Authentication for hosting the service on a server
- Plugin system to publish and write extensions to archivy
- [Git integration](https://github.com/archivy/archivy-git)
- Everything is a file! For ease of access and editing, all the content is stored in extended markdown files with yaml front matter. This format supports footnotes, LaTeX math rendering, syntax highlighting and more. 
- Powerful and advanced search. 
- Image upload
- Backend API for flexibility and user enhancements.
